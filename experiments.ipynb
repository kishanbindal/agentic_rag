      "April begins on the same day of the week as July every year and on the same day of the week as January in leap years. April ends on the same day of the week as December every year, as each other's last days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart.\n",
      "In common years, April starts on the same day of the week as October of the previous year, and in leap years, May of the previous year. In common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as July of the previous year, and in leap years, February and October of the previous year. In common years immediately after other common years, April starts on the same day of the week as January of the previous year, and in leap years and years immediately after that, April finishes on the same day of the week as January of the previous year.\n",

In years immediately before common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as September of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, March and June of the following year.\n",
      "April is a spring month in the Northern Hemisphere and an autumn/fall month in the Southern Hemisphere. In each hemisphere, it is the seasonal equivalent of October in the other.\n",
      "It is unclear as to where April got its name. A common theory is that it comes from the Latin word \"aperire\", meaning \"to open\", referring to flowers opening in spring. Another theory is that the name could come from Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. It was originally the second month in the old Roman Calendar, before the start of the new year was put to January 1.\n",
      "Quite a few festivals are held in this month. In many Southeast Asian cultures, new year is celebrated in this month (including Songkran). In Western Christianity, Easter can be celebrated on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25. In Orthodox Christianity, it can fall between April 4 and May 8. At the end of the month, Central and Northern European cultures celebrate Walpurgis Night on April 30, marking the transition from winter into summer.\n",

He became a member of the First Triumvirate, then fought a civil war against Pompey the Great, and eventually became Roman dictator until his assassination. He was born on July 12, 100 BC, and was killed on March 15, 44 BC (the Ides of March). His death was followed by famous stories such as the line “Et tu, Brute?” and he is the source of the surname Caesar, which became a title used for emperors (influencing words like Kaiser and Tsar).\n",

In Shakespeare\\'s \"Julius Caesar\", this is the first half of the line: \"\"Et tu, Brute?\" Then fall, Caesar\".\\nAccording to Plutarch, after the assassination, Brutus stepped forward as if to say something to his fellow senators; they, however, fled the building. Brutus and his companions then marched to the Capitol while crying out to their beloved city: \"People of Rome, we are once again free!\".

The mouth is transverse, very large and is nearly at the tip of the snout. The gill slits are also very large, and are designed as filtering screens. The first dorsal fin is much larger than the second dorsal fin, and is located at the back of the body. The caudal fin is semi-lunate (crescent-shaped) in adults, and with the young, the upper lobe is quite longer than the lower lobe. The whale shark has a unique \"checkerboard\" colour pattern of light spots and stripes on a dark background.\\nWhale sharks are grey, blue or brown above, with a surface pattern of creamy white spots between pale, vertical and horizontal stripes.

Its large size and extended gill slits which nearly encircle the head and caudal fin together, helps distinguish it from all other species.

Boeing did this because they thought that supersonic airliners would become much more popular than the 747 and other subsonic airliners. However, they thought that subsonic cargo planes would always be popular. It was thought that the 747 would become unpopular after 400 were sold.

This might seem normal until you compare it to similar substances. Water belongs to a group of compounds called hydrogen chalcogenides. These are made when hydrogen bonds with elements from the same family as oxygen: sulfur, selenium, and tellurium. This includes hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), hydrogen selenide (H₂Se), and hydrogen telluride (H₂Te). But, while water is a liquid, the others are all gases at room temperature. The reason is hydrogen bonding. Oxygen is very electronegative (it strongly pulls on electrons) and is small in size. Because of this, water molecules can form strong hydrogen bonds. Each water molecule can form up to four hydrogen bonds with its neighbors. This creates a kind of \"stickiness\" that holds the molecules together and makes it harder for them to break apart and turn into a gas. That is why water has a high boiling point of 100°C (212°F) for such a small molecule. The other chalcogens (sulfur, selenium, and tellurium) are larger but less electronegative than oxygen. In hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), hydrogen selenide (H₂Se), and hydrogen telluride (H₂Te), the bonds between hydrogen and the other elements are weaker. These molecules do not form strong hydrogen bonds.

The distances and sizes of the planets and other space objects are so big that it is hard to picture them using everyday ideas. The Sun is the biggest thing in the Solar System. It is so massive that it makes up almost all the mass in the entire Solar System. The Sun’s radius is about 700,000 kilometers (or 400,000 miles). Even though Earth feels big to us, about 1.3 million Earth\\'s would fit inside the Sun. Jupiter is the largest planet. It is 5.2 times farther from the Sun than Earth and is so big that over 1,300 Earths could fit inside it. Its diameter is more than 11 times that of Earth. On the other hand, Mercury, the smallest planet, is just a little bigger than Earth’s Moon.

Later, Augustus fought against his allies and defeated them.\\nLife.\\nOctavian, as he was originally called, was the adopted son of the dictator of the Roman Republic, Julius Caesar. Octavian came into power in the Second Triumvirate. This was three men ruling over the Roman Republic: Mark Antony, Lepidus and Octavian.\\nAll three were loyal to Julius Caesar, the assassinated dictator, killed in 44 BC. Following his death a civil war broke out across Rome, between those loyal to Caesar, and the conspirators, led by two of Caesar\\'s assassins, Brutus and Cassius.\\nAt first, Octavian was the junior partner in the triumvirate. Lepidus was more experienced in government, and Mark Antony was a fine military leader. The triumvirate defeated Brutus and Cassius at the Battle of Philippi, 42 BC, largely due to Antony\\'s leadership. Then they split the leadership of the Republic three ways.
